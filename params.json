  "body": "## Logic of Quantitative Research in Political Science\r\n\r\nThis repo contains information about and materials for \"Logic of Quantitative Research in Political Science\", a five-day graduate-level course held at the University of Copenhagen, February 6-10, 2017. The course is taught by [Frederik Hjorth](http://fghjorth.github.io), ph.d.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe course will use illustrative examples from the political science literature, and emphasizes the logic of research designs rather than their implementation in statistical software. The course equips students with concepts needed to understand the reasoning behind research designs and modeling in quantitative political science research.\r\n\r\nThe course is structured around five themes, one covered each day:\r\n\r\n1. Logic of quantitative research\r\n- Regression\r\n- Experiments\r\n- Natural Experiments\r\n- Content analysis\r\n\r\nThe course covers the key methodological approaches within each theme as well as canonical research articles applying the relevant approach. For more details, see [Course schedule](#course-schedule) below.\r\n\r\nStudents will also have the opportunity to present and receive feedback on their own ongoing work (see [Research paper](#research-paper) below).\r\n\r\n### Signing up\r\n\r\nTo sign up for the course, please send an email to [phdcourses@ifs.ku.dk](mailto:phdcourses@ifs.ku.dk), cc'ing me at [fh@ifs.ku.dk](mailto:fh@ifs.ku.dk).\r\n\r\n### Course schedule\r\n\r\nBlock | Day   | Time | Theme\r\n---|---|---|---|---\r\n1 | Monday    | 9-12 | Logic 1: Quantitative research designs\r\n2 |           | 13-16| Logic 2: Controversies about the quantitative approach\r\n3 | Tuesday   | 9-12 | Regression 1: Linear regression\r\n4 |           | 13-16| Regression 2: Binary DV and panel models\r\n5 | Wednesday | 9-12 | Experiments 1: Simple randomization\r\n6 |           | 13-16| Experiments 2: Clustering, blocking, noncompliance\r\n7 | Thursday  | 9-12 | Natural experiments 1: Natural experiments and RDD\r\n8 |           | 13-16| Natural experiments 2: IV, difference-in-difference\r\n9 | Friday    | 9-12 | Content analysis 1: Introduction, uses\r\n10|           | 13-16| Content analysis 2: Designs, reliability & validity\r\n\r\nFor readings for each block, see the [Literature](#literature) section below.\r\n\r\n### Dates\r\n\r\nMonday February 6 - Friday February 10, 2017.\r\n\r\n### Location\r\n\r\nUniversity of Copenhagen, Department of Political Science, Øster Farimagsgade 5, 1353 Copenhagen K.\r\n\r\n### Class participation\r\n\r\nIt is expected that you have read the texts for each day and participate actively in class discussions.\r\n\r\n### Research paper\r\n\r\nDeadline for submitting a research paper is Wednesday, February 2 at noon. The research paper should reflect a quantitative/comparative/methodological aspect of your research and be no longer than 10 pages. It is expected that you prepare comment to all papers. The papers will be distributed before the course.\r\n\r\n### Meals\r\n\r\nLunch and coffee will be provided every day. On Tuesday, February 7, there will be a dinner for all course participants at a Copenhagen restaurant (location tba).\r\n\r\n### Price\r\n\r\nFor students enrolled at University of Copenhagen or political science departments at other Danish universities, course participation is free. For students at other departments, the fee is 1500 DKK.\r\n\r\n### Literature\r\n\r\n#### 1: Logic 1\r\n\r\n- Lijphart, A.
