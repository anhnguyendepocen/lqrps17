## Logic of Quantitative Research in Political Science

This repo contains information about and materials for "Logic of Quantitative Research in Political Science", a five-day graduate-level course held at the University of Copenhagen, September 19-23, 2016. The course is taught by [Frederik Hjorth](http://fghjorth.github.io), ph.d.

### Description

The course will use illustrative examples from the political science literature, and emphasizes the logic of research designs rather than their implementation in statistical software. The course equips students with concepts needed to understand the reasoning behind research designs and modeling in quantitative political science research.

The course is structured around five themes, one covered each day:

1. Logic of quantitative research
- Regression
- Experiments
- Natural Experiments
- Content analysis

The course covers the key methodological approaches within each theme as well as canonical research articles applying the relevant approach. For more details, see [Course schedule](#course-schedule) below.

Students will also have the opportunity to present and receive feedback on their own ongoing work (see [Research paper](#research-paper) below).

### Dates

Monday September 19-Friday September 23, 2016.

### Location

### Class participation

It is expected that you have read the texts for each day and participate actively in class discussions.

### Research paper

Deadline for submitting a research paper is Wednesday, September 14 at noon. The research paper should reflect a quantitative/comparative/methodological aspect of your research and be no longer than 10 pages. It is expected that you prepare comment to all papers. The papers will be distributed before the course.

### Meals

Lunch and coffee will be provided every day. On Tuesday, September 20, there will be a dinner for all course participants at a Copenhagen restaurant (location tba).

### Price
