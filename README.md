## Logic of Quantitative Research in Political Science

This repo contains information about and materials for "Logic of Quantitative Research in Political Science", a five-day graduate-level course held at the University of Copenhagen, September 19-23, 2016.

### Description

The course will use illustrative examples from the political science literature, without focusing on the implementation of the quantitative approaches in statistical software.  The course equips students with concepts needed to understand the reasoning behind research designs and modeling in quantitative political science research.

The course is structured around five themes, one covered each day:
1. Logic of quantitative research
- Regression
- Experiments
- Natural Experiments
- Content analysis

The course covers the key methodological approaches within each theme as well as canonical research articles applying the relevant approach. For more details, see the [Course schedule](#course-schedule) section below.

Students will also have the opportunity to present and receive feedback on their own ongoing work (see 'Research paper' below).
