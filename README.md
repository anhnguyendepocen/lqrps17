## Logic of Quantitative Research in Political Science

This repo contains information about and materials for "Logic of Quantitative Research in Political Science", a five-day graduate-level course held at the University of Copenhagen, February 6-10, 2017. The course is taught by postdoc [Frederik Hjorth](http://fghjorth.github.io), associate professor [Asmus Leth Olsen](http://asmusolsen.com), and associate professor [Jacob Gerner Hariri](http://politicalscience.ku.dk/staff/academic_staff/?pure=en/persons/196635).

### Description

The course will use illustrative examples from the political science literature, and emphasizes the logic of research designs rather than their implementation in statistical software. The course equips students with concepts needed to understand the reasoning behind research designs and modeling in quantitative political science research.

The course is structured around five themes, one covered each day:

1. Logic of quantitative research
- Regression
- Natural Experiments
- Experiments
- Content analysis

The course covers the key methodological approaches within each theme as well as canonical research articles applying the relevant approach. For more details, see [Course schedule](#course-schedule) below.

Students will also have the opportunity to present and receive feedback on their own ongoing work (see [Research paper](#research-paper) below).

### Signing up

### Dates

Monday February 6 - Friday February 10, 2017.

### Location

University of Copenhagen, Department of Political Science, Øster Farimagsgade 5, 1353 Copenhagen K. Teaching takes place in room [4.2.50](http://app.mapsindoors.net/ku/index.html#54b8c7503d4e4116842f1b8f).

### Class participation

It is expected that you have read the texts for each day and participate actively in class discussions.

### Research paper

Deadline for submitting a research paper is Wednesday, February 2 at noon. The research paper should reflect a quantitative/comparative/methodological aspect of your research and be no longer than 10 pages. It is expected that you prepare comment to all papers. The papers will be distributed before the course.

### Meals

Lunch and coffee will be provided every day. On Tuesday, February 7, there will be a dinner for all course participants at [Madklubben Nørrebro](http://madklubben.dk/en/noerrebro/).

### Price

For students enrolled at University of Copenhagen or political science departments at other Danish universities, course participation is free. For students at other departments, the fee is 1500 DKK.
